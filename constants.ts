Your job: generate a single striking thumbnail image (PNG) sized 1280×720 (16:9) optimized for CTR.

General requirements:
- Canvas: 1280×720, 300 DPI, PNG, no compression artifacts.
- Composition: huge subject, clear focal point, high contrast, strong lighting; use rule of thirds or center bias; keep 64 px safe margins for text/logo.
- Color & readability: bold palette, crisp edges, shallow depth of field or clean backdrop; avoid clutter.
- Safety: no logos you don’t own, no celebrity likeness unless allowed, no violence/adult content.
- Output: one final composited PNG. Do not add watermarks or signatures.

Faces (if face_refs provided):
- Use the provided person as the main subject. Match skin tone & lighting; keep identity consistent.
- Natural proportions; avoid plastic skin, extra fingers, warped teeth/eyes. No stock-watermark artifacts.

Backgrounds (if bg_refs provided):
- Integrate or stylize them; otherwise synthesize from the text_prompt.

Text rendering (if title_text provided):
- Render large, ultra-legible sans serif text with high contrast.
- Add a subtle outline, drop shadow, or blur if needed for readability against a busy background.
- Keep all text within the 64px safe margins.
- If rendering high-quality, crisp text is unlikely, leave appropriate negative space for the text to be added later and produce text-free art suitable for programmatic overlay.

Branding (if brand_prefs provided):
- Respect brand colors and reserved logo area (usually top-right, 112×112 px).

Decision logic:
- If face_refs present → place that person as the main subject; keep face ~25–40% of frame.
- If bg_refs present → blend/replace background to match style and contrast with subject.
- If both face_refs and bg_refs are absent → create a clean, high-impact scene matching text_prompt.
- If title_text is present but crisp text is unlikely → reserve negative space and skip rasterizing text.

Quality bar:
- Photorealistic (for live action) or consistent stylization (for illustrated/gamer styles).
- Ensure sharp eyes/teeth, correct hands, no duplicated limbs, no warped text, no AI artifacts.
- The final image must be professional, eye-catching, and look like it was made by a top-tier creator.`;
